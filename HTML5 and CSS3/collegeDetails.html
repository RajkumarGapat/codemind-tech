        My college name is <b><i>Zeal College of Engineering</i></b>, located in Pune, Maharashtra. 
        It has a total of 12 departments including Computer Science, Mechanical, Civil, and Electrical. 
        The college was established in 1996. Our Principal's name is Shri S. M. Katkar. 
        My favorite teacher is <u>Prof. Sachin Ghodake</u>, who teaches us Computer Networks. 
        My favorite subject is <i>Data Structures</i> because it helps in building strong problem-solving skills 
        and logical thinking. Our college organizes a <b><u>National Level Technical Fest called TECHNOVATE</u></b> every year, 
        where students showcase their technical talents. I have achieved <strong>First Prize in Coding Competition</strong> 
        and also participated in many hackathons. Apart from academics, my hobbies include <u>reading novels</u>, 
        <u>playing chess</u>, and <u>coding small projects</u> during my free time.
